 <!-- DOM (Document Object Model)

 DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that allows JavaScript and other scripting languages to interact with HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of nodes, where each element, attribute, or piece of content becomes an object that can be modified dynamically. -->
