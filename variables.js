// Variables in JS.
// There is generally 3 varialbles used in javascript :-
// var, let and const, now "var" is not used due to block scope and functional scope.
// In modern JS. only let and const in use.
// We can change the value of let variable because this is mutrable, but not const because this is immutable.
